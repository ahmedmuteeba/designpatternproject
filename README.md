I've created this project using Java, OOP concepts(polymorphism, inheritance. abstract, interfaces, exceptions, threads, etc.) and design patterns to demonstrate my skills using this programming language.

This project's a structure of a "SHOP" and contains: Interface "Shop Interface" with abstract methods that are concretized in the "Shop" class. Interface article with 3 subclasses (3 types of articles): "Jeans", "TShirt", and "Skirt" (those classes have particular methods). Class "Customer" used for creating a "customer" instance (this class is also encapsulated and has particular methods). Two classes for exceptions handling. "ThreadForTime class" implements Runnable, used for a quick demonstration of my knowledge of threads(ThreadForTime does not inherit Thread because of SingleResponsability rule so I've used Runnable. "TestShop" class has the main method.

For more details about each method take a look in the .Java files from this project. I've used concepts like S.O.L.I.D, K.I.S.S, and D.R.Y.
